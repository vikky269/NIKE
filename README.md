This app was used to learn the basics of the tailwind CSS framework, I implemented basic animations using the framer motion and created a very basic responsive mobile nav
Through this project I got to learn the tailwind utility classes and also responsive design using tailwind css . 
Although i still have a lot to learn on tailwind css I am committed to keep on learning and improving my skillset.
